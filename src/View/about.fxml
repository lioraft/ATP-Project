We also made a few maze-solving algorithms, &#10;and the one we chose for this project is a Breath First Search algorithm.&#10;We implemented integration of a client-server architecture in this project. We developed a server that &#10;compresses the maze data using a Hexadecimal base compression technique. This compressed maze is &#10;then delivered to the client, enabling a streamlined and efficient communication process. Furthermore, &#10;when the server receives a maze to solve, it dynamically decompresses the data.&#10;&#10;We had the opportunity to expand our knowledge and skills in programming, algorithm design, and &#10;server-client communication, and we thoroughly enjoyed working on the project." />
