We also made a few maze-solving algorithms, and the&#10;one we chose for this project is a Breath First Search algorithm.&#10;We implemented integration of a client-server architecture in this project. We developed a server that compresses &#10;the maze data using a Hexadecimal base compression technique. This compressed maze is then delivered to the client,&#10;enabling a streamlined and efficient communication process. Furthermore, when the server receives a maze to solve, &#10;it dynamically decompresses the data.&#10;&#10;We had the opportunity to expand our knowledge and skills in programming, algorithm design, and server-client &#10;communication, and we thoroughly enjoyed working on the project." />
